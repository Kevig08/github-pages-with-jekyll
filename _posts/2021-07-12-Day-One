I work up early and walked 4 miles this morning in an hour.  
I did this at no incline for 15 minutes, then an incline of 1
for 25 minutes and spent the rest of the hour on an incline of 2.

Later in the day around lunchtime I did my new back and tri-ceps workout.
I prefer too do a push/pull routine on my lift days.
